Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
     use by those authorized to give the public permission to use
     material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
     other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read
     and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
     before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
     necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can
     reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed
     material, or material used under an exception or limitation to
     copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses,
     a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
     under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission
     is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any
     applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is
     not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
     under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
     authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
     restricted for other reasons, including because others have
     copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
     special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
     described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
     encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More
