# 🧪 Tech Documentation

A messy but useful collection of technical notes from my homelab experiments and the projects I’m working on.

This repo is mainly my **personal knowledge drop**: what I tried, what worked, what broke, and the shortcuts I don’t want to forget.  
If it helps someone else too, even better.

---

## ✨ What you’ll find here

- **How-Tos**
- **Troubleshooting notes**
- **Configs & snippets** (YAML, bash, systemd, etc.)

Topics may include (depending on what I’m playing with):
- Linux, Podman, containers, incus
- OpenShift, Kubernetes, GitOps, CI/CD
- Whatever I’m testing this week

---

## ✅ Conventions I use

- **Markdown first** (`.md`) so it’s easy to read anywhere
- Commands are usually tested on:
  - Linux (mainly Fedora or Arch) and macOS.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is not a polished guide, it’s my notes.  
Versions change, and some docs may age badly.

If you spot something wrong or have a better approach, feel free to open an issue or PR.

## ⭐ If this helped you

Drop a ⭐ so I know it was useful, and so I’m forced to keep it updated 😄
